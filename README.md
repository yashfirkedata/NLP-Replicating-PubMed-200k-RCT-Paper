Replicating and optimizing the deep learning model behind the 2017 paper PubMed 200k RCT: a Dataset for Sequential Sentence Classification in Medical Abstracts.

1. Where our data is coming from: https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06071
2. Where our model is coming from: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.05251

We have conducted our experiments on only 10 percent of the data due to lack of processing power.
We can train a model with same architecture as out best model with 100 percent of the data resulting in better overall model.
